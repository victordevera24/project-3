# SONA - The Social Network for Local Shopping

Does online shopping sometimes overwhelm you?  Do you sometimes find deals and interesting new products while shopping in-store?  Do you ever wish there was a online platform built, not to replace your brick-and-mortar shopping experience, but to enhance it and make it even better?

SONA is your local shopping social network.  Much like Facebook or Instagram connects you with your friends and their experiences, and much like Nextdoor connects you only to posts that affect your local community, SONA marries the two ideas and applies it to local shopping, connecting you with friends and neighbors that are finding great new products and deals exclusive to the local shoppers in your local stores.
